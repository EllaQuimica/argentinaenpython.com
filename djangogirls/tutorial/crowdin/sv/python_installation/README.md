# Komma igång med Python

Vi är äntligen här!

But first, let us tell you what Python is. Python is a very popular programming language that can be used for creating websites, games, scientific software, graphics, and much, much more.

Python originated in the late 1980s and its main goal is to be readable by human beings (not only machines!). This is why it looks much simpler than other programming languages. Det gör det lättare att läsare sig, men oroade dig inte, Python är ett väldigt kraftfullt språk!
