This page shows what are the needs for organizing different types of
events related to python, driven by the project and briefly describes
each one of them. It is only an aid to the organizers of these events
and in no way determines how should they be performed, but it is
rather a guide.

Meetup
======

What is a Meetup?
-----------------

A Meetup is an informal event in which we meet in a bar with the idea
of discussing about different technologies and sharing what have we
been doing lately.

They are generally made overnight, with the idea of sharing dinner
and a few beers, and they start with one (or two) mini-lectures 10-15
minutes each (often improvised) where one shows something that has
caught his or her attention or just something that somehow has
simplified the day.

For this mini-talk no projector or anything is needed. Although
something is displayed (no need to be a presentation) usually in a
notebook.

Usually the Meetup take place regularly: Weekly or monthly. This event
is very informal and promotes keeping an active and connected
community. In many cases it serves as a propellant for other events.

Requisites
----------

Nothing special. This will depend on what you intend to do at the
meeting. 

If you decide to make a recurring event, a good idea is to create the
event on the Meetup_ site so it is made public and notifications will
reach to all attendees.

Sprint
======

What is a Python Sprint?
------------------------

A sprint is getting together to program with the aim of pushing an
existing (or not) project and teamwork. The idea is to fix as many
bugs as possible or add some functionality to these projects. It is an
informal event in which anyone can participate and it is not neccesary
any knowledge. Just we get together to program in groups in order to
help each other and program together.

Usually, at the beginning of a Sprint attendees are introduced, and
then projects are proposed with a brief introduction to each one of
them: what it is about, what technology is used, etc. Then each of
the attendees join them and thus, work groups are set.

Requisites
----------

Is a good idea that the place in which the Sprint is carried count on
these facilities:

* Air conditioning
* Good internet connectivity, WiFi
* Cooking service
* Possibility of joining the tables
* At least 10 people capacity
* Open from morning to evening


Some comments
-------------

* Tell attendees to bring electrical outlets with them, because there
  are always lack of power points.

* It's a good idea to create a web form (Google, for example) to make
  an inscription. This form should have Name, Last Name and Email as
  mandatory fields, so we are able to communicate with the audience in
  case of any novelty (change of place, for example). The form may
  also show the projects proposed to work, with a checkbox to join.

* It is a good idea to carry the project repositories you plan to work
  with, downloaded previously not to kill the internet. And, if
  possible, properly configured so you don't waste time doing this.

* To avoid saturating the Internet, you can create a `pip cache`_ and
  serve it on the internal network. It takes less than 10 minutes and
  you can have hours of gain :)

PyDay
=====

What is a PyDay?
----------------


A PyDay is a *slightly more formal* event than the above and consists
of a *full day of Python*. That day talks on various topics related to
Python are held throughout the day. These talks are agreed for a
period of 45 minutes giving space at the end for 15 minutes of
questions.

It usually starts with 3 lectures in the morning, then lunch (which
may or may not be in charge of the organization) and in the afternoon
continues with 4 more talks. There may also be a space for an
afternoon Sprint.

Towards the end of day, you can organize `Lightning Talks
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk>`_ consisting of 5
minutes lectures (fixed) that can cover any topic. Not necessarily
related to Python, Free Software or programming.

At closing time, it usually takes place a draw with some prizes
donated by the sponsors (shirts, books, merchandising of the event,
etc).

You can also consult this `guide for organizing a PyDay at the Python
Argentina's website <http://python.org.ar/PyDay>`_.


Requisites
----------

* An auditorium / classroom / theater / etc with capacity for about
  100 people.

* Air conditioning.

* Good internet connectivity, WiFi.

* Projector to display presentations of the speakers.

* Sound system.


.. admonition:: Note

   If you organize any of these events, it is a good idea:

   * Sending an email to `Python Argentina's mailing list
     <http://python.org.ar/ListaDeCorreo>`_ to publicize the
     organization of this meeting and so adding more interested
     people.

   * Updating `Python Argentina's news page
     <http://python.org.ar/Noticias>`_ mentioning that this event will
     be performed.

   * Adding the event to the `International Python Official Calendar
     <https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEventsCalendar#Submitting_an_Event>`_.

   Join us in this initiative! It is not difficult to organize any of
   these events and you can be a pioneer in your city helping to
   spread Python :)
