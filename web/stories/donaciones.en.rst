Receiving money *in exchange for something* was always something very
sensitive for me. However, since the beginning of the project I've
been asked about how people can make a donation to support and help it
to keep moving on.

That is why, I decided to start a new page to accept donations *in
exchange for something*. What is that *something*? Well, in first
place, nothing material. But the money that I receive will be used to
improve the reach of the project in any valid direction for itself.

The money will be used for, for example:

* Courses

  * Logistics and organization
  * Rent rooms

* Broadcasting material

  * Stickers
  * Micro-Tutorials
  * Cards
  * Banners
  * T-Shirts

* Mobility

  * Car's fixes
  * Gas
