.. description: We want @EllaQuimica to travel to PyCon and you can help us!
.. type: text


We rolled the dice, got double 6... and came up to the board fulfilled
with good news!, but first a short introduction.

Perhaps you know about us or maybe you just don't. If you already meet
us there is nothing more that to add, but if :doc:`you still do not
know who we are <the-team>` we will tell you a little about us and
the reason for this campaign.

In late 2013, the "Argentina in Python" project started from scratch
and without any support. During the first year, and with the help of
the `Python Argentina <http://python.org.ar/>`_ community, some small
events were organized in that country. Arriving at the end of that
year, `I came across Johanna Sanchez in Santiago de Estero
<http://elblogdehumitos.com.ar/posts/rafaela-santiago-del-estero/>`_,
who fell in love with the project and the Python community and a few
weeks later decided to get immersed in travelling and sharing
knowledge in different towns, cities, provinces and
countries!. Everything got out of hand. Today we can say that we have
visited more than 8 countries over the past 2 years. Incredible!

Together, we are a 3-legged table: Python community, Johanna
(`@EllaQuimica <https://twitter.com/EllaQuimica>`_) and I (Manuel).
Together, we have organized dozens of events Python (`including 8
Django Girls workshops <http://argentinaenpython.com/galeria/>`_),
we have collaborated in translation, created pages of initiation in
Python as :doc:`I want to learn Python <quiero-aprender-python>` and
more. Event though we put a lot of effort, it emphasized that a
fundamental leg of the table is the Python community, to which we
return again to for help.

What do we need? Money!

About a month ago Manuel was invited to participate as Keynote Speaker
of the biggest Python conference in Spain: `PyCon Es
<http://2016.es.pycon.org/es/>`_ (I can't believe it is true). Around
those days, we wanted Johanna to take part of it as
well. Nevertheless, we had in mind that Colombians could not go to
Europe without a VISA and all the paper work and requirements to have
one demands. Today, from Spain itself, and thanks to the infinite
support of `Juanlu <https://twitter.com/astrojuanlu>`_ from
`@Pybonacci <https://twitter.com/pybonacci>`_, we were told `that the
VISA is no longer required but it's only required a letter of
invitation
<http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/especiales/visado-union-europea/>`_, a
return ticket and enough money to stay are all the conditions to enter
the country. So, Let's do it!

Why do we need money? Unfortunately, we can not afford all costs that
involve moving two people to PyCon Spain (October) and then to PyCon
Argentina (November).

Why do we want to attend both conferences? In Spain we want to eat the
world. Yes, literal!. We want to learn from others, have other flavors
in the mouth, understand how events across the world are organized and
more. Then mix all that with our *Latino experience* and apply it in
South American countries. In PyCon Spain both of us will be
participating as guides of the `Django Girls Workshop
<https://djangogirls.org/almeria/>`_ and we will also be doing
everything in our power to help apart from my talk as Keynote Speaker.

In Argentina we don't know exactly how thing are going to happen
because the organization isn't ready yet, but if they have a group of
Django Girls Workshop organizers, we would like to participate as
guides and help from a distance. In the absence of such a group, it is
very likely for us to create and ofter the goup of helpers as we did
last year at PyCon 2015 in Mendoza. Which brought a wonderful fruit!

We will do everything in our power so that the whole"Argentina in
Python" team can attend to `PyCon Spain
<http://2016.es.pycon.org/es/>`_ and `PyCon Argentina
<http://ar.pycon.org/>`_!  So, keep encouraging more people to believe
themselves and organize independent events for share knowledge with
more people.

How much money do we need? Approximately USD 1800, taking into account
that the tickets from Ecuador-Madrid and Ecuador-Argentina are around
USD 900 each one. Everything count, even the smallest amount of money
can help us. We say from experience! :)
