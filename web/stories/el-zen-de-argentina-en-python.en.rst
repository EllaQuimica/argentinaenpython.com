If you are a Python programmer you must know "`The Zen of Python
<http://www.thezenofpython.com/>`_" and if not, just open a Python
Interpreter and write:

.. code:: python

   >>> import this

Here are detailed some *rules and properties* of the proyect (Our Zen)
that help us day to day to make the whole trip, in all of its
directions and dimensions, a great success, do not produce stress and
make all of us happy:

#. We travel without time, but with liabilities.

#. We never hit the road at night or if it's raining, unless it be
   strictly neccesary.

#. We check the OpenStreetMap_, `Google Maps`_ and another *route* map
   in paper to be completely sure about our route.

#. We don't enter on unpaved routes (ground, cobblestone, etc) with
   "Errante". [#]_

#. We use the Software Libre community, CouchSurfing_, camping and, as
   last option hostel/hotel as acommodation. [#]_

#. Where possible, *before* hit the road, we try to have the
   acommodation for that night solved.

#. Once in destiny, we avoid using the car as transport.

#. "Errante" is *too much* important. [#]_

#. We ask/request for complete directions: street, number and "betweens".

#. The events *must* be free (as beer) for the attendees. [#]_

#. Seat belt and "Max 110 Km/h" are a *MUST*.

.. [#] we take care of our house and transport, so we save money and
       we can reach more places.

.. [#] this allows us to share our trip, experience and knowledge
       besides saving our resources.

.. [#] we try to park the car under a roof at night, close to us or in
       a safe place.

.. [#] we also deliver events ":doc:`a la gorra <donations>`"
       (collaboration) and, in case we really need it, we could make
       some paid course.
